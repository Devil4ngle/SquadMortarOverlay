## Will this program get you banned?
No, this program won't get you banned. Here's why it's completely safe:

The program is just a transparent window that sits on top of your screen, similar to having a calculator window open. It never interacts with Squad in any way - it doesn't inject code, read memory, or send inputs/keystrokes to the game. 

Looking at the code:
- It only takes screenshots of what's already on your screen using pyautogui.screenshot() in image_layering.py [(look here)](https://github.com/Devil4ngle/SquadMortarOverlay/blob/main/scripts/image_layering.py) - no different than using Windows' built-in screenshot tools like PrintScreen or Snipping Tool

- Creates a transparent overlay window using standard Windows functionality (tkinter)

This program simply displays the same information that SquadCalc provides in a different format. According to the definition of cheating - "using a third party tool to gain an unfair advantage" - SquadCalc is technically cheating since it provides advantages through automated calculations. However, all players don't view it as such and it's widely accepted as a legitimate tool, and that's why this program is completely fine too.
