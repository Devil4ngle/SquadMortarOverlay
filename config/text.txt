 When this application is started, 
 http://localhost:8000/ (SquadCalc) needs to be
 refreshed if already open.

 When assigning new coordinates, the location will be updated upon 
 restarting the application or adding new mortar points 
 on http://localhost:8000/ (SquadCalc).

 When pressing the overlay hotkey the Minimap in Squad must be 
 open (the capslock one) and fully zoomed out with side bar opened.
